# Stacked - Probably Works
## Download and Installation Instructions
This document pertains to the installation process for Stacked - Probably Works. This will guide you through the download, and the installation of the modpack in an easy to understand and almost fool-proof way.
### Getting Started
1. The first thing you will need is the Curseforge App. It is possible to install the modpack manually but is much more complicated and I don't really remember how, so for now, I would suggest using the Curseforge app.

2. Once Curseforge is installed you will need to configure it to manage your minecraft installation. The cool thing about Curseforge is it doesn't need to be installed in the same place as Minecraft.

3. The next step will be downloading the modpack from here. From the landing page, and the top of this one, there will be a large-ish green "Code" button. Select the dropdown and choose "Download ZIP".


### Installing Modpacks using Curseforge
1. In Curseforge, once you are in the Minecraft area, you should be able to find the "Import" button, near the top left of the page. This will then open a menu with two options: Importing the profile from a .zip file, or by using a code. Choose the .zip option, and select the .zip file you downloaded from here.

2. This will setup the modpack's installation, and from here you will be able to manage the profile. When you click "Play" for the first time, Curseforge will install all the mods, and setup the files in the correct structure.

### Launching the Game
This is the final step, and once you launch the game for the first time, everything should be ready to go.
